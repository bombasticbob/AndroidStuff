* MessageBox.java - this is a sample 'Message Box' API that will do what it says on the tin;
that is, it will display a simple message box to which the user must respond before the
function returns.  The return value of the function (for Yes/No anyway) indicates which
button was pressed.

* SkButton.java - this implements a button class that can be placed in the layout, which is
re-drawn a bit using 3D Skeuomorphic 'press' indications, similar to what you would normally
expect in a desktop application that pre-dates Windows &quot;Ape&quot; (8).


Others to be added at a later date.
